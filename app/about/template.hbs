    <h3>Mount Chirripo</h3>

    <div class="landing-about section">
      <p>Costa Rica is famous for tropical beaches, but this tiny country is also home to some of the tallest mountains in Central America. Cerro Chirripo, Costa Rica’s highest peak, rises 12,533 feet above sea level and offers sweeping views of the surrounding
        Talamanca Mountains. Its dramatic peak is reached via a 12.4-mile (20-km) trail that rises over 7,218 feet (2,000 meters) from the tiny mountain village of San Gerardo de Rivas. Along the way, hikers pass through cloud forests and páramos—a unique
        ecosystem found only at high elevations in the New World tropics. Rocky outposts punctuate the otherwise barren hills, and feed a series of glacial lakes that earned the park its iconic name: Chirripo means ‘eternal waters.’ From Chirripo’s summit,
        sweeping 360-degree views tumble down over graceful valleys and shimmering lakes. On clear days you can see both the Caribbean and the Pacific!</p>

<h3>The Hike</h3>
<div class="about-details">
  <p>The ultimate in Costa Rica hiking is to reach the summit of Mt Chirripo – Cerro Chirripo. But it is not for the faint of heart. Exceptionally strong hikers can summit and return in a single day, but most mortals spend two to three days hiking the steep
    mountain. Overnight hikers spend the night at Crestones Base Camp, a rugged lodge located at 11,155 feet (3,400 meters) that’s 3.4 miles (5.5 km) from Chirripo’s summit. Although hardly luxurious, Crestones base camp puts Chirripo within the reach
    of average hikers and makes sunrise summits feasible.</p>


  <p>The trailhead to Chirripo is located 0.6 miles (2 km) from the center of San Gerardo de Rivas. Crestones Base Camp is located 9 miles (14.5 km) from the trailhead. Average hiking time to the summit: 8–10 hours. Those hiking Chirripo are required start
    their hike before 10am. (The average descent is 5–7 hours, and visitors are required to depart before noon.) The trail starts off steep and rugged, providing a good taste of what’s to come. Wooden sign posts mark each kilometer. At kilometer 4 you’ll
    reach the official park boundary. At kilometer 7.5 you’ll reach Llano Bonito Refuge, which offers water and bathrooms. Once past the refuge, you’ll encounter three of the trail’s most challenging sections: Cuesta de Agua (“Water Slope”), Monte Sin
    Fe (“Faithless Mountain”), and Cuesta de los Arrepentidos(“The Slope of Regret”). As you climb you’ll see lots of burnt trees. Forest fires—some natural, some man-made—have burned in the park nearly every decade since the 1950s.</p>
